Our project is taking shape despite covid! Some of our partners have been in lockdown for several months, but we all agreed to adapt to the new circumstances and do blended activities. We'll do some of the mobilities virtually, but we hope to turn to physical mobilities in the near future.

Last week we had our second partner's meeting, and we are so eager to get our students involved too. Some of them have already started talking about the main aspects of the project. In a few weeks we'll be all talking about them here together in the TwinSpace.
