## Our Mission

> Environmental issues, above all the topic of climate change, have an increasingly great impact on political and social development and decisions. Students are more and more affected by them, also in their everyday life. We believe that for the younger generation, a cooperation on an international level is the best chance to secure a sustainable livelihood. That is why we regard it as indispensable to teach students skills and competences which enable them to understand analyse and possibly contribute to a solution of these problems also on an international scale. This includes providing them with solid knowledge about the topic, choosing a scientific approach to deal with ecological questions, reflecting with students the consequences and scope of the individual acting and enabling them to thoroughly take part in an international discourse.

## Aims

* To improve knowledge and the use of ICT as a communication tool
* To understand the importance of teamwork
* To meet new people, realities and different working methodology
* To share eco-friendly initiatives in our communities
* To exchange information about how sustainable our schools are
* To raise awareness of the importance of protecting the environment
* To create attitudes and improvement towards sustainable lifestyle
* To come to a proposal to make each countryâ€™s school more eco-friendly
* To understand the scientific approach
* To develop an app to be used in our communities

## Work Process

Students will collect empirical data to identify problems. They will deal with questions on how their individual acts impact the environment both locally and globally. Also with the role civil groups have on decisions and what they can do to change things. They will reflect on how to convey messages and publish information. The final product will enable us to measure the ecological footprint our schools have.
